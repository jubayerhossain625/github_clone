🚀 GitHub Repository Explorer (Flutter)

This Flutter application is a clean-architecture–based GitHub Repository Explorer built with Flutter, Riverpod, and Dio. It fetches popular Flutter repositories from GitHub and presents them in a modern, responsive UI.

The app supports pagination with infinite scrolling, pull-to-refresh with a custom 🚀 Rocket animation, and sorting by stars or last updated date (ascending/descending). Users can search repositories by owner name locally, toggle light/dark themes, and view detailed repository information.

Each repository includes owner details, stars, last update time (human-readable), and a full-screen avatar preview using PhotoView. Tapping actions opens the repository or profile directly on GitHub.
